ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kateboyd

I am a Full Stack Developer, recently graduated from an intensive Coding Bootcamp where I trained in React (HTML, CSS/Tailwind, JS), PHP, Laravel & SQL. I am comfortable with Git version control and code reviews using GitHub pull requests.

I am currently learning Next.js and Prismic (headless CMS). I understand the principles of agile working, and have experience working alone as well as pair programming projects.
